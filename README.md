Parallel Sort
=============

Parallel sorting algorithms for large arrays implemented in Go.

We implemented parrallel versions of the mergesort, quicksort, radix sort,
brick sort (odd-even sort), and bitonic sort sorting algorithms in go. The
implementations are designed to handle large input arrays.

This is a semester project for 2020 Spring EE W382V Parallel Algorithms class at
UT Austin. For the project, we compared the performance of the different
algorithms with a variety of inputs.
